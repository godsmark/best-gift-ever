gift-it
=======

Gift giving is supposed to be a fun time to give to others and see happy faces when opening presents but it doesn't always happen that way.

I tried to hone in at the root of the problem and pinpoint the reasons why gift giving has failed over the years.

I came up with the following reasons:
1) You have a lot of people to give gifts to (usually around Christmas)
2) There is never enough time to think about what to give or time to go shopping
3) And lastly you want to give a gift that person will actually use

My app, that lets the user compile a list of items from the internet in one place with the ability to send to others ending the gifter and giftee conundrum.
